**For Dorsal-Ventral HPC Coordination**

This repository contains code developed to study dorsal-ventral hippocampal coordination at different levels, including single units, assemblies, and local field potentials (LFP).

## Repository Structure

- **`toolbox/`**: Contains both general-purpose and specific functions.
- **Main folder**: Includes various analysis pipelines.

## Code and Documentation

- Written in **MATLAB**.
- Each section of code is accompanied by **comprehensive documentation** and **line-by-line explanations**.
- Each function in the `toolbox/` folder includes:
  1. A brief overview.
  2. Detailed descriptions of inputs and outputs.
  3. A list of required dependencies.

## Required Toolboxes

- **FMA Toolbox**
- **LopesdosSantos_AssemblyToolbox**  
  *(Already included in the main branch)*
