for Dorsal-Ventral HPC Coordination

These codes have been developed to study dorsal-ventral  hippocampal coordination at different levels (single units, assemblies,  LFP).

In the "toolbox" folder, you'll find both general and specific functions.
In the main folder, various pipelines have been provided to perform the analysis.

The codebase is created using MATLAB, and comprehensive  documentation, along with line-by-line descriptions, has been provided  for each section of the code.
The documentation of each function located in tool_box subfolder includes:
1) Brief description of the
2) Detailed description of each input and output
3) List of functions that are needed.



Requiered toolboxs:
FMA toolbox
